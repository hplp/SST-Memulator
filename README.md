To give some background information, I have been working on creating a communication channel between a host PC and the FPGA, so that I can combine SST simulator with Memulator (emulated memory). This is going to happen over the PCIe as it is the fastest method. I am using the RIFFA IP from github https://github.com/KastnerRG/riffa to achieve this. This folder has "HOW_TO_TEST" file in it which describes my test file. With this test, I am taking the trace files generated by running hopscotch benchmark on gem5 and I am feeding data to the FPGA in accordance to estimate the total travel time. This shows us the cost of using the PCIe for communication.

The data for testing memory traces on emulated memory cannot fit to this github page. They will be in the zipped file provided.
