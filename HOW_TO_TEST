You are going to need Ubuntu 16.04 for the driver to work properly and 
I suggest using Quartus 18 for synthezing HDL for FPGAs. 

Under /docs/riffa_documentation.pdf, you will find everything related to riffa
including how to install the driver on the PC.

You need to first install the driver and make sure the OS can see the FPGA with riffa
core synthesized on it.

The setup that I have is a DE5 Stratix V board that is attached to the PC via the 
PCIe.


I have test code under c_c++/linux/x86/sample_app called "trace_feed.c". The way we
are compiling any c or c++ code with riffa driver is

gcc code.c -o code.o -lriffa
g++ code.cpp -o code.o -lriffa


The test code "trace_feed.c" takes the trace information we created via gem5 + dramSim3 using
the hopscotch benchmark and based on that info, feeds data into the FPGA to measure the total 
travel time over PCIe to get an estimation of how much speedup we can achieve combining SST 
simulator and Memulator (emulated memory)
